* To reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

Update Anamoly :  Same information may be stored in many rows and while updating data this leads to inconsistencies.

Insertion Anamoly : While inserting data where attributes cannot be recored. This leads to storing many null values which is a wastage.

Deletion Anamoly : Deleting some data may completely delete some other unrelated data.


	If a relation schema is in BCNF then all redundancy based on functional dependency has been removed.
	
R is in BCNF iff for each of its dependencies X -> Y , atleast one of the following conditons hold,
	
	# X -> Y is a trivial functional dependency ( Y subset of X )
	
	# x is a superkey for schema R.
	
	(Super Key - set of attributes within a table whose values can be used to uniquely identify a tuple 
	Candidate Key is a minimal set of attributes necessary to identify a tuple -- Minimal Superkey)

Non-prime attribute - that does noot occur in any candidate key

2NF :
	relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF  AND every non-prime attribute of the relation is dependent on the whole of every candidate key.
